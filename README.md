# BLOG-APP
I have created the blog app using react js, First of all, I have created the project name blog by entering the command npx create-react-app blog and installing all modules. Then we create the folder name component under src and make two jsx file post.jsx and posts.jsx . And last we import the component into App.js and styling the main into App.css.
